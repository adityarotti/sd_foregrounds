Spectral Distortion Foreground Study

1) Search literature for all possible foregrounds for PIXIE like experiment and determine amplitude and spectrum (SED)
2) Fisher Matrix forecast

--just monopole brightness (specific intensity) no anisotropies


Signals:
- Blackbody CMB
- Thermal SZ ("y") + relativistic effects
- mu distortion
- r-type ("residual", or non-mu/non-y) distortion
- Cosmic Infrared Background (dusty galaxies)
- Galactic dust
- Galactic synchrotron
- Extragalactic synchrotron/radio emission
- Galactic "anomalous microwave emission" (perhaps spinning dust)
- Galactic free-free emission
- Emission from various spectral lines (e.g., CO -- see for example


3/31/16
- Working on adding the planck best fit params for the foregrounds
- Figuring out units as well

4/1/16 
- Adding templates
- Comparing with plots made by Brad for spectrometer proposal
