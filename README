# Spectral Distortion Fisher Forecasting

## CMB Signals:
- Blackbody CMB
- Thermal SZ ("y") + relativistic effects
- mu distortion
- r-type ("residual", or non-mu/non-y) distortion
- H and He recombination lines

## Foregrounds:
- Cosmic Infrared Background (dusty galaxies)
- Galactic dust
- Galactic synchrotron
- Extragalactic synchrotron/radio emission
- Galactic "anomalous microwave emission" (perhaps spinning dust)
- Galactic free-free emission
- CO lines
